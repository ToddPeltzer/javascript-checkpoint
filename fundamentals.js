// #1: Create an array of strings called `foods` that contains three foods.
// Type your solution immediately below this line:
// var foods = ["apple",  "orange", "plum"]
 let foods = ["pizza", "burger", "ice cream"]
console.log(foods)
// #2: Access the last item in the array and assign to a variable called `last`.
// Type your solution immediately below this line:
// var last = foods[2]
let last = foods[2]
console.log(last)
// #3: Create an empty array called `favoriteFoods`.
// Type your solution immediately below this line:
// var favoriteFoods = []
let favoriteFoods = []

// #4: Create a `for` loop that adds each string in `foods` to `favoriteFoods`.
// Type your solution immediately below this line:
// for (i=0; i<foods.length; i++) {
//     favoriteFoods.push(foods[i])
// }

for (i=0; i<foods.length; i++)
    let favoriteFoods = push().foods[i]
    console.log(favoriteFoods)

// #5: Create an object literal called `instructor` that contains three key-value pairs
// Type your solution immediately below this line:
// var instructor = {name: 'Tom', age: 40, subject: 'history'}


// #6: Add a `has-office-hours` (spelled exactly) property to `instructor` by accessing
// it (do not change the original object you typed above) and assigning it
// a boolean value.
// Type your solution immediately below this line:
// instructor['has-office-hours'] = true

// if you are confident up to this part, scaffold up an HTML file and use basic js to render your favorite foods on screen, or map out your instructors, 
// and set up a button that filters out the ones who do not have office hours
